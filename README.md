YaLD - Yet another LED driver
=============================

32 channel PWM driver, controlled by a AVR microcontroller,
controllable by DMX or IR remote.


DMX data port
-------------
The RJ45 connector for DMX data follows the ANSI E1.27-2 standard:
1: DMX+
2: DMX-
3: n.c.
4: n.c.
5: n.c.
6: n.c.
7: GND
8: GND

(This port *is not* compatible to Traxon/e:cue DMX interfaces.)
